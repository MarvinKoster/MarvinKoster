✨ Welcome to my special repository! ✨

This repository highlights my journey as a beginner developer.

## Skills

- **Python**: Currently learning the basics and exploring different projects.
- **HTML & CSS**: Gaining experience in building simple web pages and front-end design.
- **PyCharm**: My main IDE for Python development.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Previously used as my coding editor.
